Recently, I have been thinking about what it means to care for others. Specifically what it means to care for others as a leader. Here are some thoughts on the dynamics of a caring leader.

Let's start with how not to do it before discussing how to do it well:

* "Caring" for people so that they will work harder or produce the right results is wrong. Most people are pretty smart and can see right through that veneer. Pretending to care is probably worse than not caring at all, because at least with the latter, one is being authentic.
* "Caring" for people at the expense of the mission of the organization or team is also not appropriate. Yes, a leader should be empathetic. However, putting personal relationships above company goals means lack of integrity towards the company. And a lack of integrity is a non-starter for any leader.
* Finally, do not be selective in one’s caring. Equity is something everyone hopes and longs for. We long for an equitable society to live in and we hope for justice to prevail. There is a desire in us to see everyone treated fairly, and for everyone to get an equal opportunity to succeed. If people hope and long for these things outside of work, they are going to hope and long for the same inside of work. And every leader should ensure that they are fair and equitable to their employees. This is not to say that top-performers should not be differentiated from others. Yes, top-performers need to be rewarded and bottom-performers need to be assisted. The key is to set the same standard for everyone and be explicit about it.

### Aspects of 'care'

Caring for people should occur at a professional and at a personal level. Behind every professional is a human being with hopes and dreams, needs and aspirations, and trials and perils. And it is important as a leader to understand the professional and personal needs of an employee and cater to both to the extent to which they can.

**Professional**

Every leader should understand the career aspirations of their employees. They should support their people and work with them to get to their desired destination. In caring for professional aspirations of employees, leaders should act as coaches. A good coach not only wants the team to win, but also wants individual members to do bigger and better things. All my employees have experienced the 'push' to do better professionally. It is often in the form of ensuring that they write down their aspiration and build a plan towards accomplishing it. Then, we discuss these plans periodically.

Another aspect of 'professional caring' is to ensure that your employees do not walk into any political landmines at your organization. And if they do, help them to navigate through the challenges. And finally, be your employee's biggest cheerleader among your peers and your boss when they are making an impact.

**Personal**

It goes without saying that caring for people at a personal level is something every leader should practice. And it is perhaps one of the toughest dichotomy in leadership to navigate through. Caring for your team might be easy when they are a high performing team. Or it is a lesser challenge when you have a team that you have hand picked from scratch. However, the chances are that, at some point in your career, you may inherit teams that are not of your choosing, or end up leading teams that may not be high performing. In cases like this, it is not necessary that you have to suspend your attribute of genuine care so that you may exercise your attribute of being a high performing leader. Both could co-exist as long as clear lines of communication and expectations are set between you and your employees.

In summary, empathy is a key attribute for a leader since leaders are responsible for their people -- their successes and their failures. It is next to impossible not to care for the successes or failures of your employees and be a leader at the same time. Empathy is a relative quality. Some are naturally more empathetic while others have to cultivate it. If a leader lacks empathy, they should intentionally learn to care for and understand the perspective of their employees.

When I think of the type of person I would like to work for, perhaps the first quality that comes to mind is that of “a leader who cares.” Therefore, as someone who is in a position of leadership, I strive to practice what I preach, and care for my people in the same way. I welcome you to do the same.
