I’ve had the opportunity to be part of many Security Incidents over the course of my career. And through those engagements, I have noticed a few recurring and valuable traits that set apart great defenders. Contrary to my initial disposition that technical know-how is the biggest predictor of success, I have come to the conclusion that what matters the most in relation to success is the defenders’ mindset - the subject of the post.

For the purposes of this blog, the term “Defender” is anyone who is engaged in responding to Incidents. It could be SOC Analysts, Incident Responders, Threat Analysts, Forensic Analysts etc. This blog will describe the various attributes of a great defender. The qualities mentioned below are not given in any particular order. However, be aware, this post will not explore how to develop great defenders; that is a topic I am still pondering on, and I might write about in the future.

### A Curious Mind

Security incidents involve a series of questions that are asked and individuals figuring out ways to answer them. I’ve found that naturally curious people tend to come up with the best set of questions. They have an innate desire to want to know more about what happened, how it happened and why it happened, which leads them to ask good investigative questions. It may or maynot be that they are able to answer their own questions (depending on their technical expertise and tool familiarity). However, having the attitude of “wanting to know more” is a must have skill for defenders. Time and again, I’ve seen people who are not curious, or in some instances who do not want to be curious, end up making incorrect or premature conclusions on incidents.

### A Skeptical Mind

“Never trust, always verify” has become the cliche for zero trust. However, it is a very important mindset required for a defender. This goes to not trusting technology and people unless corroborating evidence is provided. While not trusting people might come across as antithetical to everything we know about team building, it is something a defender must employ to find truth. The key here is that a defender is not necessarily distrusting the person conveying information, but the information being conveyed. Unfortunately, multiple experiences have proven that during an incident, people are operating with imperfect knowledge, and the assertions they make (albeit, with the right intent) might be incorrect. Often people make assumptions about how their environment is configured and, therefore give answers based on what they know to be objective. However, if they are unable to substantiate their claims with a scan result or configuration artifact, the best of defenders would not treat it as conclusive. As the defenders are naturally curious and inherently skeptical, they will ask for further proof.

### A Mind Drawn to Action

Incident Response is similar to Emergency Response. Emergency Responders are trained for running towards action so as to provide assistance. Likewise, Security Incident Responders should also be wired to run towards action. However, in the thick of incidents, I’ve noticed two types of personalities emerging. One that is drawn to action and the other that is not. The former show up at every incident and contribute while the latter is there as a result of process or as a result of direction. And as time passes, the former group starts taking leadership roles in incidents while the latter is content with being in the back seat. Since Incident Response is an Emergency Response function, it is important for all defenders to have a bias towards action and have a mindset of being drawn to action. While I am not advocating that every responder should show up to every incident, every responder should have the mindset of wanting to show up at every incident. And to avoid the swarm effect, leaders of defenders should institute rotation schedules. It is also important for leaders of defenders to understand different personalities and their motives so as to create a balanced team.

### A Persistent Mind

Great responders have the mindset of “not giving up”. When they are unable to answer investigation questions, they pivot to other ways of trying to answer the questions until all options are exhausted. They follow rabbit holes until they find the right rabbit hole that gets them to the truth. Great defenders also have an innate ability to understand how much information is enough information and express their findings using probabilistic statements. This is especially important since ‘analysis paralysis’ is real in Incident Response and at some point defenders will need to realize where they have reached the point of diminishing returns with their analysis.

### A Risk-Aware Mind

Often in Incident Response, decisions on response actions have to be made to mitigate incidents. Although an IR plan would provide a framework for decision making, it may not encompass every scenario. And as such, sometimes defenders are left to make tough decisions between business continuity and security objectives. Great defenders are able to make decisions that balance risk and reward. This is a hard thing to do. However, this is a necessary thing, since risks are not always black and white. Many shades of gray are present in taking risks; finding the right balance is required when defenders have to make decisions that impact business. The incorrect way to make a recommendation is to take a zero risk tolerant posture and recommend the most restrictive mitigation - a trap that defenders can easily fall into and should be avoided.

### A Critical Mind

Critical thinking is perhaps an overused concept in security circles. At the heart of it, critical thinking boils down to a systematic and logical way of forming opinions or decisions while considering as many perspectives as possible. Critical thinking requires a person to be aware of their cognitive biases and actively try to compensate for it when making decisions or carrying out investigations. While knowledge plays a big part into the critical thinking process, the underlying mechanism remains consistent - a critical thinker realizing the limit of their knowledge, which in turn results in seeking out further knowledge. Security incident investigation requires critical thinking since almost every incident is trying to answer the fundamental question of why and how an adverse event occurred. Considering the fact that adverse events have many different causes, it is important for defenders to consider all aspects and logically follow the paths that are most plausible to determine the root cause.

### Conclusion:

Described above are the qualities great defenders possess. These qualities are interdependent and reinforce each other. Such as, a persistent mind drives bias towards action, or a curious mind drives a skeptical mind etc. Hence it is important that focus is given to all these aspects when considering training plans for workforce development.
Of note, I do not mean to diminish technical acumen. Sometimes, it is the technical acumen that amplifies some of the qualities. However, it is unlikely that defenders will be fully knowledgeable in all the various technologies that they encounter. In such instances, the defenders should use the soft skills mentioned above to navigate those incidents.
In conclusion, I would encourage aspiring defenders to cultivate these qualities through self evaluation and cognitive training (training the mind). Leaders of defenders should seek out such qualities in your new hires and devise ways in which you can foster these qualities in your existing team.
