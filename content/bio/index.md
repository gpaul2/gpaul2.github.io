**TL;DR**: Christian. Husband. Father. Information Security Professional. Views expressed here are mine only.

## Long Version

"_I believe in Christianity as I believe that the Sun has risen, not only because I see it but because by it, I see everything else_" - C.S. Lewis. This quote is perhaps the easiest way to explain how I view the world and what Christianity means to me. I am who I am because Christ died on the Cross of Calvary. And as such, I am passionate about learning more about Christ, following Him and His teachings to the fullest extent possible.

I am also an Information Security professional with a software engineering background. I enjoy teaching and am an Adjunct professor at a local university where I teach a graduate level course to Computer Science and Cyber Security students. I am passionate about building capabilities, teams and developing new leaders. I enjoy tinkering with technology and following rabbit holes just because it is fun!
